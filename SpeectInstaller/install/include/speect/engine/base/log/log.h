/**
 * @ingroup SBase
 * @defgroup SLogging Logging
 * Logging facilities.
 * The logging system provides a mechanism to write @a formatted
 * messages to different types of streams. It is used by all the error
 * and debug reporting facilities in @ref SErrDbg, and therefore aims
 * to be as robust as possible. If any error occurs during one of the
 * logging functions, an error will be printed to @c stderr, and the
 * logging system will attempt to write the message to @c stdout.
 *
 * The logging system consists of three components:
 * <ul>
 * <li> @ref SLogEvent
 *
 * Logging events describe the severity of the log message. The event
 * level can also have an influence on the format of the message
 * output.
 *
 * </li>
 * <li> @ref SLayout
 *
 * The layout is the format of the log message. The format is
 * influenced by the log event level and the information supplied to
 * the underlying layout formatter.
 *
 * </li>
 * <li> @ref SLogger
 *
 * The logger outputs the log message to a stream.
 *
 * </li>
 * </ul>
