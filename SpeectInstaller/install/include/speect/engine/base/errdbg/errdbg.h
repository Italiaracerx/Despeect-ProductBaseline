/**
 * @ingroup SBase
 * @defgroup SErrDbg Error handling and Debugging
 * Error handling and debugging module, utilities, macros and definitions.
 *
 * The error handling mechanism works on the basis that @a all functions are passed
 * a pointer to an error code variable as a function parameter. If an error occurred
 * during function execution, then the function can set an appropriate error code in this
 * pointer (there are exceptions to this rule, i.e. @ref SThreads and @ref SLogging).
 *
 * All calling functions can then check the error pointer and take appropriate action based
 * on the error code. Each calling function can then add context to the error and in turn
 * set an error code for it's calling function again, thereby giving a detailed trace from
 * the origin of the error to the source of the error. All errors are logged by the @ref SLogging
 * system.
 *
 * There are two types of errors, @a fatal errors and @a non-fatal errors. Fatal errors
 * are usually programming errors, memory errors and so forth, where there are no alternative
 * options if such an error occurred. Non-fatal errors are errors that occurred from which
 * the system can recover or reset to a previous state and continue.
 *
 * The error handling system as described enables one to have a detailed "backtrace" that has
 * been logged to some or other place, and therefore makes development and bug tracking a much easier
 * task.
